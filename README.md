# foodie-canteen-app
<p>Foodie App is an android app that provides digital payment option for school students through their iCard (using NFC).</p>

<p>This app uses firebase to store food items, and uses NFC to enable payment for the food.
This project, while trying to promote Digital India movement, tries to solve the issue that school students need to face when they don't have cash with them and are hungry by enabling cashless payment through their iCard.</p>

<p>The only downfall of this project is that it requires NFC enabled phone in order to work.</p>
